Cleansing data, EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), Clustering, and Radar chart by Junmay, Nov. 2020   


### Dataset
- Billboard hot 100 from 1999 to 2020 [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/danield2255/data-on-songs-from-billboard-19992019)
- Audio features of 160,000 or more songs between 1921 and 2020 (spotify) [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks)
  
    you should download datasets to run this code.

### Goal
- **Visualize clusters of hot 100 songs easily**
- which can be developed to recommendation system

### Process
1. Merge datasets (billboard hot 100 songs + attributes by Spotify)
2. Cluster songs
3. Visualize: make radar charts and export song list

### Study point
- Merge(join) tables using pandas by multiple columns
- KMeans clustering
- Visualizing by radar
